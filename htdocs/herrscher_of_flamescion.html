						<p>As the 4th Honkai Eruption occurs by her hands by her "true self", Kiana drastically changes. She matures into a person who is trying to find the resolve to counter the 2nd Herrscher haunting her, and in her guilt she becomes a much more quiet, mature and thoughtful person, often carrying a serious face. Although she found the resolve to keep going, she is still afraid of anyone getting hurt because of her.</p>
						<p>Additionally, when Kiana eventually stays at Anti-Entropy's Salt Lake base, she keeps to herself. When people avoided her in the cafeteria, she decided to eat later rather than scare them. In terms of friendly relations, she tries to avoid asking to participate. She is still quite considerate of others nonetheless.</p>

						<p>It was in the deepest reaches of her dreams that she would always see that girl's tragic, fragmented, memories. She would look away, close her eyes, and run with all her might, but all this only deepened the sneer that the other presence within her wore. Now, she has decided to face everything head-on: to accept who she is, to bear the heavy burden of the past. This road is destined to be a thorny one, but the will that she carries shall also become the flame with which she shall carve the way forward.</p>
						<p>The greatsword is weighty. Heavy. What thoughts were running through her teacher's head when she once wielded it? She met her once more in the shadows created by the crimson gem. There was still so much she wanted to say at the end of that journey--- in the face of those gentle eyes. Yet words were unnecessary --- the things that her teacher intended to impart to her had always been in her hands.</p>
						<p>When she unleashed that final blow in the Theater of Domination, beams of light coalesced around the blade of her greatsword. As if affected by the wishes of the people all around her, they transferred her companions' strength into her and kindled the hope gathering around her form. The young maiden did not turn back, but she knew in her heart that it was the gazes that were upon her --- that it was her companions --- who had given her the strength to carry on--- giving her a flame that would not be extinguished even amidst the darkest of nights.</p>
